# Earthquake Project

Welcome to the Earthquake Project! This application allows you to explore earthquake data retrieved from the USGS earthquake API.

## Overview

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easily input start date, end date, and minimum earthquake magnitude.
- **API Integration:** Utilizes the USGS earthquake API to fetch earthquake data.
- **Data Parsing:** Parses the JSON response from the API to extract earthquake details.
- **Random Earthquake Display:** Showcases details of a random earthquake from the retrieved data.
